This End-to_End MS Excel Project showcases XLOOKUP, INDEX MATCH, SWITCH TRUE() functions plus Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts in order to analyse Coffee Beans Sales. I also enjoyed creating a Power BI variation of the whole project where I performed Merge Queries operations in the query editor so as to achieve Excel's XLookup and Index Match functions. In addition to this, I created a new column in the Table View to calculate Total Sales as well as 2 other columns to categorise Coffee Type and Roast Type columns with same Excel function Switch True(). As far as visuals are concerned, I used a Total Black Canvas background.
